# Case-Time-Series-Predict-Gold-prices
Time Series Project


Historically, gold was utilized as a kind of currency in different places of the world, including the United States. Precious metals such as gold are now kept by central banks across the world to ensure the repayment of foreign loans as well as to control inflation, which reflects the country's financial strength. Recently, growing international economies such as China, Russia, and India have been major purchasers of gold, while the United States, South Africa, and Australia have been major sellers. Forecasting the increase and fall in daily gold rates can assist investors in determining when to purchase (or sell) the commodity.But Gold prices are dependent on many factors such as prices of other precious metals, prices of crude oil, stock exchange performance, Bonds prices, currency exchange rates etc.

The goal of this project is to understand and apply time-series models like ARIMA, SARIMA in forecasting the price of gold 
What Exactly Is a Time Series?
A time series is a collection of data points that have been indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. A time series is most frequently defined as a succession of photos taken at evenly spaced moments in time. As a result, it is a series of discrete-time data. Examples include the daily closing price of the S&P 500 index, the daily average temperature, and so forth. Time Series are evaluated to discover long-term trends in order to anticipate the future or undertake other types of analysis.

Problem statement

Many investors buy gold as a safe haven to protect themselves against a possible catastrophe, profit from these tremendous increases in the price of gold, diversify their portfolio and protect themselves against inflation.

With recent fears of an economic recession looming in the distance, investors are looking to recession-proof their portfolios. Gold has historically been touted as an asset that booms in a recession because unlike fiat currencies such as the Dollar, Yen and the Pound, it has inherent value as a commodity currency.

However, with the rapidly changing economic landscape, does this still hold true? Is gold a good commodity to buy now for later profits?

Between ARIMA and Facebook Prophet, ARIMA shows a better fit between actual data and predicted data.
